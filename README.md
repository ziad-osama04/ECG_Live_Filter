## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
**ECG-Live-Filter** is a real-time ECG signal processing and visualization tool. This Python-based application enables users to load ECG data, apply noise-removal filters, and visualize the signal dynamically. Designed for biomedical engineers, researchers, and AI developers, this tool enhances ECG signal analysis.  

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**  
- Develop a real-time ECG visualization tool.  
- Implement noise-removal techniques for cleaner signal processing.  
- Provide interactive playback controls for better analysis.  
- Enable easy data export for further study.  

## ðŸš€ **Features**  
âœ… **Real-Time ECG Visualization** â€“ Stream and analyze ECG signals dynamically.  
âœ… **Noise Filtering** â€“ Apply high-pass, low-pass, and band-stop filters.  
âœ… **Playback Control** â€“ Start, pause, resume, and adjust signal speed.  
âœ… **Customizable Display** â€“ Modify window size and signal parameters.  
âœ… **Data Export** â€“ Save processed ECG signals for future research.  

## ðŸ“Š **Results & Demo**  
**Initial Version - Basic ECG Signal Reading**
This first version successfully reads and plots raw ECG signals but lacks noise filtering and advanced features.
